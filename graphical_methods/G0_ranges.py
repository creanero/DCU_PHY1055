def linspace_demo():
    """
    np.linspace() takes three arguments:
    a start point (x0), a stop point (xf) and a number of points (N).
    It returns a Numpy array, with N evenly spaced values,
    starting with x0 and ending with xf.
    For example, np.linspace(0, 5, 6) returns [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.],
    while np.linspace (0, 5, 5) returns [0. 1.25 2.5 3.75 5.0].

    Another useful tool is np.arange().
    It also takes three arguments:
    a start point (x0), a stop point (xf) but now a step-size (S) instead of a number of points.
    It also returns a Numpy array, again starting with x0,
    this time with values separated by S and ending at or before xf.
    For example, np.arange(0, 5, 1) returns [0 1 2 3 4].
    However, the endpoint may be included due to floating point rounding errors, so be aware of that
    For example, np.arange(1, 1.3, 0.1) returns [1. 1.1 1.2 1.3]
    if you need to be sure the endpoint isn't included, use the argument endpoint=False
    For example, np.arange(1, 1.3, 0.1, endpoint=False) returns [1.  1.1 1.2]

    Meshgrid takes two or more arrays as arguments (we'll use two for the moment)
    Each argument corresponds to the points along one of the dimensions we want to create a grid of.

    It returns two, 2-D arrays, each of which iterates through the elements of the input arrays
    but along different axes.

    For example,
    x_points=[0, 1, 2]
    y_points=[3, 4, 5, 6]
