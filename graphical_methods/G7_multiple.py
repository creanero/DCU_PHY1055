    You could import this function and use it in the Lotka-Volterra model.
    I would suggest you find a more elegant solution than that.

    When exploring options for parameters of ODEs it is useful to plot more than one specific quantity. For example in
    the LVM model it is helpful to look at vectors, time series, phase plots simultaneously.
    The following code illustrates how mathplotlib is used to combine plots into one figure.

    :param r_mesh: a meshgrid of possible values for rabbit population
    :param f_mesh: a meshgrid of possible values for fox population
    :param dr: the expected changes in rabbit population at a given point in the mesh
    :param df: the expected changes in fox population at a given point in the mesh
    :param r: array containing a set of rabbit populations over time given particular initial conditions
    :param f: array containing a set of fox populations over time given particular initial conditions
    :param t: array containing a set of points in time
    :return: None
