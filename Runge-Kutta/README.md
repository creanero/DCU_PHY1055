# Runge-Kutta Lab
In this experiment, you will be working with the *Runge-Kutta Method*, which is a more complex, but more accurate method of numerically approximating a differential equation compared with the Euler Method. See the “Background information” tab for more details on how it works.
In this lab, you will use code excerpts taken from this git repository. You should use the commands you have learned in the git tutorials to `clone` a copy of this code to your own computer as follows:

` git clone https://github.com/creanero/DCU_PHY1055.git `

You cannot push new changes you make to this repository, however, because it is owned by the user `creanero`. You should consider creating a new repository under your own GitHub profile using what you learned in the tutorials so you can `push` updates to GitHub and `pull` them to other computers as needed.
If you do so, this will allow you to “cite” your code repository in your report to allow the marker to review your code if they want to.
